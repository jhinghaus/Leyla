# Leyla

A sidescroller game about lightpollution.

This project is built using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) framework and may be
plugged into a [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) app in the future.

## How to run this

Serve the `www` folder using a simple HTTP Server of your trust, e.g. the
Python3 http server:

```
cd www
python3 -m http.server
```

Open your browser and call the address your http server is running on, if you
follow the example above it will run on `http://localhost:8000`.
